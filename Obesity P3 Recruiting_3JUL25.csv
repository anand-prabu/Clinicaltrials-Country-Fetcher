NCT04645719,Dose of Magnesium Sulfate Infusion in Obese,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04645719,,RECRUITING,"Magnesium sulfate has been shown to be a successful tool in a large number of clinical areas. Its benefits include neuroprotection, control of eclampsia / pre-eclampsia, control of intraoperative blood pressure, decreased neuroendocrine response during laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation and reduced levels of postoperative pain and consumption of analgesic.

Obese patients have become more and more frequent in the operating rooms, due to the increasing prevalence of this population worldwide. However, although they have received magnesium sulfate as part of the analgesic strategy in many centers, there has been no study demonstrating the appropriate dose of this medication in obese patients.

IWDAQ is an 18-item measure that uses an adaptive design to provide a personalised assessment of daily activity limitations associated with excess weight. At the baseline assessment the study participants choose the 3 activities (items) they would most like to improve the weight loss and rate the degree of limitation in each of these activities. At follow-up assessments, the study participants again rate the degree of current limitation in each of the same 3 activities. The measure yields the IWDAQ composite score with a score range from 3 to 15 with higher scores indicating greater personalised activity limitation., From baseline (week 0) to week 104|Change in Control of Eating questionnaire (CoEQ): Craving Control score, Measured as score points. CoEQ is a 19-item multidimensional patient reported outcome (PRO) that assesses the experience of hunger, satiety, and severity and type of food cravings. CoEQ consists of 4 subscales that measure craving control (5 items), positive mood (4 items), craving for sweet (4 items), craving for savoury food (4 items), and 2 single items that address hunger and satiety. Each item is evaluated on a 0-10 (i.e., 11-point) numeric rating scale. The total score for each subscale is calculated as the sum of the item scores divided by the number of items in the subscale. Scores ranges are thus: Craving Control 0-50/5 = 0-10); Positive Mood (0-40/4 = 0-10); Craving Sweet (0-40/4 = 0-10); Craving Savoury food (0-40/4 = 0-10); single items that address hunger and satiety (0-10). For the craving control subscale, the subscale score is reversed so that a higher score represents a greater level of craving control., From baseline (week 0) to week 104|Change in CoEQ: Positive Mood score, Measured as score points.

NCT03516968,Monthly Boluses Versus Daily Doses for Correcting Blood Vitamin D Deficit in Obese Children and Adolescents,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03516968,OBEVIDOS,RECRUITING,"Childhood obesity is one of the most serious public health challenges of the 21st century, with an increasing prevalence over time in developed countries. Overweight and obese children and adolescents are likely to remain so into adulthood and to develop chronic diseases at a young age, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

Obese patients, whether adults or children, are likely to have low serum vitamin D levels due to sequestration and/or volumetric dilution of this fat-soluble vitamin in adipose tissue. Studies have established a link between vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency and chronic diseases such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes and other metabolic problems.

Determining physiological 25(OH)D levels to ensure optimal phosphocalcic metabolism and bone mineralisation requires the use of functional markers: parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, assessment of the intestinal calcium absorption fraction, assessment of bone mineral density and bone mineral content using absorptiometry.

Vitamin D deficiency leads to malabsorption of calcium and phosphate in the digestive tract, with concentrations, especially of calcium, tending to fall in plasma, resulting in hypersecretion of PTH, which mobilises bone calcium to maintain subnormal blood calcium levels.

Each unit increase in BMI is associated with lower serum vitamin D concentrations: given these low concentrations in this population associated with the risk of developing pathologies, it is important to ensure adequate vitamin D supplementation.

The latest paediatric recommendations recommend, for children aged between 1 and 18 with vitamin D deficiency, a supplement of 2,000 IU/day for at least 6 weeks or a bolus of 50,000 IU once a week for at least 6 weeks.

There are different dosage regimens for the replacement of vitamin D deficiency depending on the country: there is a lack of data on the appropriate dosage and administration regimens for vitamin D supplementation in cases of deficiency, particularly in obese children and adolescents. A prospective, randomised clinical trial will make it possible to define the vitamin D supplementation regimen best suited to increasing serum vitamin D levels in these children and adolescents suffering from obesity.",NO,"Obesity, Childhood",DRUG: Monthly bolus of cholecalciferol per os|DRUG: Daily dose of cholecalciferol per os,"Proportion of patients reaching the therapeutic target defined as vitamin D (25(OH)D) serum level ≥ 50 nmol/L and < 120 nmol/L, Vitamin D (25OH)D) serum level, Month 3","calcium dosages, blood safety dosages, Month 3|phosphore dosages, blood safety dosages, Month 3|vitamin D (25(OH)D) dosages, blood safety dosages, Month 3|urinary calcium, urinary safety dosages, Month 3|creatinin, urinary safety dosages, Month 3|Treatment compliance, amount of treatment taken (Daily arm: patient diary and weighting of returned treatment at M3.

NCT04578652,Fiber and Metformin Combination Therapy in Adolescents With Severe Obesity and Insulin Resistance,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04578652,,RECRUITING,"This is a 12-month, single center, three-arm parallel design, double-blind, randomized clinical trial, to compare the effects of supplemental dietary fiber and metformin (MET) alone and in combination over 12 months on glucose metabolism (insulin resistance \[IR\]), inflammation and BMI in adolescents with obesity and IR, and to assess the relationship between therapeutic intervention(s) and changes in gut microbiome composition and function.

Since MET and FIBER have been shown to reduce weight and increase insulin sensitivity through distinct but overlapping mechanisms of action, our central hypothesis is that the combination of FIBER + MET will have a synergistic effect and be more effective than FIBER or MET alone in improving metabolic function (IR) and reducing BMI and inflammation in adolescents with obesity, IR and family history (FM) of T2DM.

It gives rise to higher risk of psoriatic arthritis, more severe disease and also poorer response to biologics. Weight loss can lead to reduction in psoriasis severity. Previous studies had demonstrated the efficacy of older glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP1 RA) on improvement of psoriatic disease activity. Effective weight loss has been achieved by newer GLP1 RA.7 It is also known to reduce cardiovascular outcomes in patient without diabetes. Trials on the effect of semaglutide on psoriasis has not been performed except case reports.

Semaglutide is an injectable prescription medicine that may help adults and children aged 12 years and older with obesity or some adults with excess weight (overweight) who also have weight-related medical problem to help them lose weight. It contains a GLP1 RA indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control. It has potential anti-inflammatory effects on top of weight reduction, that may lead to improvement in psoriatic disease activity.

This is an open-label, single-armed, prospective pilot trial on obese, psoriasis patients. The investigators aim to recruit 14 patients. Patients will be maintained on standard care for their psoriasis. Add-on treatment with semaglutide of up to 2.0mg per week will be administered to the intervention arm in addition to lifestyle intervention.

Improvement of metabolic manifestations helps in the control of symptoms, including subfertility. Metformin has been commonly used to decrease insulin resistance and weight in PCOS patients suffering from obesity. Glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) agonist semaglutide is also effective in managing different metabolic features, including obesity and insulin resistance. There is limited data about using a combination of semaglutide and metformin in women with PCOS suffering from obesity. This study aims to compare the metabolic changes after giving a combination of low-dose semaglutide and metformin vs. metformin alone over 12 weeks among women with PCOS and obesity. This open label randomized trial will be conducted in the Department of Endocrinology, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU). After obtaining informed written consent, a total of 30 patients with PCOS and obesity will be enrolled conveniently (sampling) in the study as per inclusion and exclusion criteria from the outdoor, indoor, and PCOS clinic, Endocrinology, BSMMU.

In Mexico, according to data from the National Health and Nutrition Survey (ENSANUT) 2018-2019, the prevalence of overweight in adults is 39.1% (36.6% in women, 42.5% in men), of obesity is 36.1% (40.2% in women, 30.5% in men) and of abdominal adiposity 81.6% (88.4% in women and 72.1% in men), with a higher proportion found in the north of the country.

In 2010, it was estimated that obesity was the main cause of 3.4 million deaths, the main complications being cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and various types of cancer.

The complications of obesity are very varied, mainly presenting changes in the metabolic profile, such as increased blood pressure and abdominal circumference, hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia. Another of the main complications derived from obesity is insulin resistance, which is defined as a decreased biological response of peripheral tissues to a specific concentration of insulin with consequent compensatory hyperinsulinemia.

The treatment of obesity is based on lifestyle changes (diet and exercise), in addition, there are pharmacological and surgical treatments, however, they are not applicable to the entire population, so despite being a highly prevalent disease with major complications, current therapeutic options are insufficient.

NCT05816798,Photobiomodulation in Chronic Knee Pain in Patients Who Are in PreRehabilitation for Bariatric Surgery,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05816798,,RECRUITING,"Chronic pain is a global public health problem, which intensifies even more in the obese population, reaching about 33% of these patients. Among the topography, chronic knee pain affects 80%, constituting an important cause of disability and decreased quality of life. In addition, in grade 3 obesity, also called morbid obesity, in which bariatric surgery is already indicated, knee pain makes it difficult or prevents participation in the pre-habilitation program that includes physical therapy through therapeutic exercises with the aim of reducing postoperative complications. In this sense, a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial will be conducted with the objective of evaluating the effect of photobiomodulation (PBM) on pain and functionality of obese patients with chronic knee pain who are in a prehabilitation program for bariatric surgery, discussing its role as an analgesic therapy and modifier of peripheral and central sensitization mechanisms of the pain pathway. PBM is a safe treatment option, with no undesirable effects and low cost. The primary outcomes will be pain intensity, through visual analogue scale, and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) questionnaire, validated version for Portuguese - Brazil. Secondary outcomes will be pressure pain threshold and rolling pinch maneuver measured by digital algometer. Other exploratory outcomes will be 6-minute walk test, knee range of motion, SF-36 quality of life questionnaire. There will be 2 groups: an intervention group (photobiomodulation associated with standard physiotherapy treatment) and another placebo group (device turned off associated with the same standard physiotherapy treatment). The application sites will be knees and lumbar paravertebral 2 times a week for 12 weeks. The dosimetric standards will be 4J/point in the knees and 3J/point in the lumbar.

However, PA levels are often low in individuals with overweight/obesity, and primary care providers (PCPs) are tasked with addressing this issue. The investigative team developed and successfully piloted integrating a Fitbit program into clinical care, where patients were referred by PCPs, and PCPs could view PA data in the Epic electronic health record. Though feasible, PCPs wanted additional support for PA management. The investigative team proposes a reimbursable service of a health coach to work collaboratively with PCPs, to deliver a Fitbit-supported PA program to patients with overweight/obesity who have been prescribed a weight loss medication for weight loss for a minimum of 3 months. In Aim 1, the team will enroll PCPs to refer patients to a 12-week health coaching program.

NCT06423599,Effect of Weight Loss on Physical and Cardiac Performance in People With Obesity and Heart Failure,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06423599,FIT-HF,RECRUITING,"The benefit of weight loss in patients with obesity and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is controversial. Semaglutide has shown cardiovascular (CV) risk-reduction and impact on CV risk factors including overweight, dysglycaemia and hypertension in subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The STEP-HFpEF (Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People With Obesity and HFpEF) recently demonstrated, at 1-year, to not only reduce weight considerably, but also significantly improve health-related quality of life, functional status scores and 6-min walk distance in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Also, the recently concluded SELECT trial was the first CV outcome trial with semaglutide in patients with overweight or obesity and established CV disease, including heart failure (but no T2D). Semaglutide demonstrated a 20% reduction in MACE, defined as the composite of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke.

These landmark findings have important implications for clinicians -as they mean that weight loss and/or semaglutide as anti-obesity pharmacotherapy could be a treatment strategy for secondary prevention of CV disease in patients with overweight or obesity.

It is, however, unknown whether weight loss with either calorie-restricted diet or semaglutide has beneficial effects in obese subjects with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. Also it is unclear whether semaglutide has cardiovascular benefits irrespective of starting weight and amount of weight loss.

HFpEF occurs when the heart muscle unable to relax efficiently to pump the blood around the body. This leads to fluid build-up, breathlessness and inability to tolerate physical exertion. People who develop HFpEF do less well because treatment options are limited. Pilot data in patients with obesity and diabetes and a small number of patients with HFpEF have shown improvements in exercise capacity and reversal of changes in the heart and blood vessels. This study will assess if this is achievable in a multi-ethnic cohort of patients with established HFpEF. A total of 102 adults will be invited and allocate by chance into two groups: either a 12-week diet or health advice on how to lose weight. The study will determine if weight loss over 12 weeks can improve heart function, symptoms and ability to exercise.

NCT04971720,PRECISION-BP: Precision Chronopharamacotherapy Targeting NP-RAAS-BP Rhythm Axis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04971720,PRECISION-BP,RECRUITING,Obese individuals have a higher prevalence of nocturnal hypertension and non-dipping blood pressure (BP). These conditions are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) events and death. Natriuretic Peptides (NPs) are hormones produced by the heart which directly regulate BP by causing dilation of blood vessels and by removing sodium and water from the body. NPs have a 24-hour day-night rhythm and this controls the day-night rhythm of BP as well. The NP-BP rhythm relationship is broken down in obese individuals. Obese individuals also have lower circulating NP levels. Lower circulating levels of NPs and elevated renin hormone (a part of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System \[RAAS\]) at nighttime may contribute to the high nocturnal blood pressure in obese individuals which puts them at a higher risk of developing CV events. This current study seeks to determine the biological implications of chronopharmacology for synchronizing NP-RAAS-based blood pressure therapy with the physiological diurnal rhythms to restore the normal diurnal rhythm of blood pressure in obese individuals.,NO,Obesity|Cardiovascular Diseases|Hypertension|Nocturnal Blood Pressure|Natriuretic Peptides|Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System,DRUG:

NCT05488288,Bariatric SUrgery With Mesh REpair of Ventral Hernia: a Randomized Controlled Trial,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05488288,BeSURE,RECRUITING,"The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate that hernia recurrence (VH) repair with non absorbable mesh concomitant to Bariatric Surgery (BS) decreases the risk of VH, with or without surgical repair, during the first two years after BS when compared to VH suture repair without mesh.

As secondary objectives, the study aims to assess the impact of concomitant VH repair with non absorbable mesh versus suture repair in morbidly obese BS candidates on the following measures: - hernia recurrence at 1 year after randomization; - reoperation for hernia recurrence at 2 years after randomization; - strangulated hernia, surgical infection and mesh bulging at one year after randomization; - postoperative morbidity and mortality at 90 days after randomization; - benefit-risk ratio; - chronic pain at three months, six months, one year and two years after randomization; - quality of life during the two years after randomization; - incremental cost utility ratio; - short- and mid-term weight loss.

Radiological hernia is defined as any protrusion of abdominal contents, including the anterior parietal peritoneum, visible as discontinuity of the fascial layers.
